# NDS-CardReader
Custom PCB which converts NDS pins to Universal Pins

## About this project

This project was used to analyze the traffic between a NDS cartidge and the NDS.
However, this PCB does nothing, instead it converts the NDS pins to Universal Pins in order to connect it with a Protoboard
or whatever you want to connect it.

## Usage
This PCB is made using KiCad, just make the gerber files and upload it on JLCPCB
